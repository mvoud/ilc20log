# ILC20LOGLIB v2


## Pros

1. **Traceability**: ILC20LOG provides solid traceability for the application, allowing for the logging of events, errors, and crucial information. This is essential for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

2. **Time Savings**: It simplifies the debugging process by offering a detailed record of events, making it easier to identify and resolve bugs efficiently.

3. **Configurability**: Logging libraries like ILC20LOG often offer flexible configuration, enabling you to define what types of messages to log, where to store them, and how to format them.

## Cons

"NO CONS"

## Objectives

1. first is to help out people with console debugging
2. removeing the option std::cout that is hard to write
3. easy to implement in the projecte with no interuuption

## Setup

1. **Setup the header file**: You can do this using Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
2. **Include the header files**: In your `main.cpp` file, include the necessary header files. For example:
    ```cpp
    #include <icg_algorithm.hpp>
    ```
3. **Define your class**: You can define your class as follows:
    ```cpp
    ic20_algorithm* cLogger = new ic20_algorithm;
    ```
4. **Initialize the library**: You can initialize the library with the following command:
    ```cpp
    cLogger->ic20_athm_init();
    ```
5. **Define your custom log message**: Now you can define your custom log message. Here are a couple of examples:
    - To print a message log:
        ```cpp
        cLogger->messageType(ICG20_CONSOLE_LOGGER_TYPE_INFO).c20_print("Hello World");
        ```
    - To print example messages of all types of logs inside the library:
        ```cpp
        cLogger->ilc20_exampleMessages();
        ```

---

Example Logger Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <icg_algorithm.hpp>

int main() {
    ic20_algorithm* cLogger = new ic20_algorithm;

    cLogger->ic20_athm_init();
    cLogger->ilc20_exampleMessages();
}
```

Example Your message Code:
-
```cpp
int main() {
	ic20_algorithm* cLogger = new ic20_algorithm;

	cLogger->ic20_athm_init();
	cLogger->messageType(ICG20_CONSOLE_LOGGER_TYPE_INFO).c20_print("Hello World");

}

## Will you expand this library with custom user options?
Yes, I will expand this library with custom options by the user but for now it only provides pre-defined messages...
